# PRISMA – Precision Task OS

---

## 📌 Overview

PRISMA is a modern, gamified productivity operating system built entirely with frontend technologies.  

Instead of traditional to-do lists, PRISMA turns tasks into **missions**, tracks performance in real time, and delivers measurable productivity metrics through a clean, immersive UI.

## 🧮 Productivity Engine

PRISMA calculates performance using structured formulas:

### Efficiency

\[
Efficiency = \frac{Completed}{Total} \times 100
\]

### Score System

\[
Score = (Completed \times 50) + (Total \times 10)
\]

This makes productivity measurable and motivating.
